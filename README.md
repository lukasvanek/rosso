## Rosso solutions

Platform for no-code development

User can create app logic from prepared components. The "code" of such app is stored in Redux and persisted in localStorage. By clicking save, app ID is generated and the state of app is stored in MongoDB, that app can be therefore retrieved by accessing the link with ID.

There is also Layout mode (WIP), which enables user to organize everything visually and make the app ready for production use.

App is running in production here (frontend only, saving is available in local environment yet) <a href="https://rosso.solutions" target="_blank">rosso.solutions</a>
